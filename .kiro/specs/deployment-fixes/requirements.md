# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the deployment errors and warnings in the Next.js application. The errors include React linting issues related to unescaped entities, missing dependencies in useEffect hooks, and image optimization recommendations. Fixing these issues will ensure successful deployment and improve the application's performance and maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix React linting errors related to unescaped entities, so that the application can be deployed successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the code contains unescaped single quotes (`'`) in JSX THEN the system SHALL replace them with the appropriate escaped entities (`&apos;`, `&lsquo;`, `&#39;`, or `&rsquo;`).
2. WHEN the build process is run THEN the system SHALL pass without unescaped entity errors.
3. WHEN files are modified THEN the system SHALL maintain the original functionality and appearance of the components.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix React Hook dependency warnings, so that the application follows React best practices and avoids potential bugs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN useEffect hooks are used THEN the system SHALL include all required dependencies in the dependency array.
2. WHEN the dependency is a function THEN the system SHALL consider using useCallback to memoize the function.
3. WHEN multiple state variables are interdependent THEN the system SHALL consider using useReducer instead of multiple useState calls.
4. WHEN the build process is run THEN the system SHALL pass without React Hook dependency warnings.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optimize image loading, so that the application has better performance and user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `<img>` tags are used THEN the system SHALL replace them with Next.js `<Image />` components.
2. WHEN converting to Next.js Image components THEN the system SHALL specify appropriate width, height, and loading properties.
3. WHEN the build process is run THEN the system SHALL pass without image optimization warnings.
4. WHEN pages load THEN the system SHALL demonstrate improved Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) metrics.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure all fixes are compatible with the existing codebase, so that no new issues are introduced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN changes are made THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with the existing TypeScript types.
2. WHEN components are modified THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing functionality.
3. WHEN the application is built THEN the system SHALL pass all existing tests.
4. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL function correctly in the production environment.
