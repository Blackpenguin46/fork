# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The CyberNex Academy platform needs a UI restructure to enhance the existing section pages (Community, Insights, Academy) with card-based layouts and improve navigation. The main landing page will remain for first-time visitors, while authenticated users will access the enhanced section pages directly. The navbar needs cleanup by removing the redundant home button since the logo already handles home navigation.

This restructure will create a more intuitive user experience with enhanced card-based layouts within each section, real-time statistics, and improved navigation flow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the navbar to have clean navigation without redundant buttons so that I can navigate efficiently using the logo for home navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the navbar THEN the system SHALL remove the home button since the logo already handles home navigation
2. WHEN a user clicks the logo THEN the system SHALL navigate to the appropriate home page based on authentication status
3. WHEN an unauthenticated user clicks the logo THEN the system SHALL navigate to the main landing page
4. WHEN an authenticated user clicks the logo THEN the system SHALL navigate to their appropriate dashboard or section

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user visiting the Community section, I want to see organized content cards with real-time statistics so that I can quickly understand community activity and navigate to specific areas of interest.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the Community page THEN the system SHALL display cards for Discord servers, Reddit communities, GitHub resources, learning forums, Skool communities, and events/meetups
2. WHEN Community cards load THEN the system SHALL display relevant statistics like member count, active discussions, daily active users, and expert count
3. WHEN a user clicks on a Community card THEN the system SHALL navigate to the specific subsection (e.g., /community/discord-servers)
4. WHEN statistics are unavailable THEN the system SHALL display loading states or fallback values
5. WHEN Community cards are displayed THEN the system SHALL use consistent styling with hover effects and visual feedback

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user visiting the Insights section, I want to see organized content cards with a live news feed so that I can stay updated on current cybersecurity threats and navigate to specific intelligence areas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the Insights page THEN the system SHALL display cards for cybersecurity news, industry insights, threat intelligence, security breaches, emerging trends, and research reports
2. WHEN the Insights page loads THEN the system SHALL display a live threat feed with recent cybersecurity news
3. WHEN displaying news items THEN the system SHALL show title, summary, source, publication time, severity level, and category
4. WHEN news items have different severity levels THEN the system SHALL use color coding (critical=red, high=orange, medium=yellow, low=blue)
5. WHEN the live feed updates THEN the system SHALL refresh automatically every 5 minutes
6. WHEN a user clicks on an Insights card THEN the system SHALL navigate to the specific subsection (e.g., /insights/cybersecurity-news)
7. WHEN the news feed fails to load THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error handling with fallback content

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user visiting the Academy section, I want to see organized content cards with learning progress tracking so that I can navigate to specific learning areas and track my educational journey.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the Academy page THEN the system SHALL display cards for learning paths, tutorials, labs/exercises, YouTube resources, documentation, cheatsheets, glossary, learning forums, and security tools
2. WHEN Academy cards load THEN the system SHALL display relevant statistics like learning paths count, courses count, articles count, and premium content availability
3. WHEN a user clicks on an Academy card THEN the system SHALL navigate to the specific subsection (e.g., /academy/learning-paths)
4. WHEN an authenticated user views Academy cards THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators for completed content
5. WHEN Academy cards display premium content THEN the system SHALL indicate subscription status with appropriate visual cues

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the enhanced section pages to maintain their current functionality while integrating seamlessly with the new card-based layouts so that I have both overview and detailed access to content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates from a section card to a subsection page THEN the system SHALL maintain the current enhanced functionality of that subsection
2. WHEN on a subsection page THEN the system SHALL provide clear navigation back to the parent section
3. WHEN section pages load THEN the system SHALL maintain existing features like filtering, search, and content organization
4. WHEN users access subsection pages THEN the system SHALL follow the planned URL structure (/community/discord-servers, /insights/cybersecurity-news, /academy/learning-paths, etc.)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the platform to be responsive and performant across all devices so that I can access the restructured interface on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard on any device THEN the system SHALL display a responsive layout appropriate for that screen size
2. WHEN on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL stack section cards vertically with touch-friendly interactions
3. WHEN loading dashboard statistics THEN the system SHALL implement proper loading states to maintain perceived performance
4. WHEN statistics fail to load THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade with placeholder content
5. WHEN users navigate between sections THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth transitions and consistent styling

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the live news feed to integrate with reliable cybersecurity data sources so that I receive accurate and timely threat intelligence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the news feed loads THEN the system SHALL integrate with multiple cybersecurity data sources (NIST NVD, security news RSS feeds, threat intelligence APIs)
2. WHEN aggregating news from multiple sources THEN the system SHALL consolidate and deduplicate content appropriately
3. WHEN displaying news items THEN the system SHALL sort by publication date with most recent items first
4. WHEN news sources are unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue functioning with available sources
5. WHEN API rate limits are reached THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate caching and fallback mechanisms
