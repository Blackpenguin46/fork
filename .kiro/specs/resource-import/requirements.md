# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enable the bulk import of 1,000+ resources into the database, ensuring they are properly categorized and organized so they appear correctly in the web application. The import process will handle resource metadata, categorization, and validation to maintain data integrity and provide a seamless user experience when accessing these resources through the frontend.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to bulk import resources from structured data files, so that I can efficiently populate the database with a large number of resources without manual entry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator provides a structured data file (CSV, JSON, or XLSX) THEN the system SHALL validate the file format and structure.
2. WHEN the system processes the import file THEN it SHALL validate each resource entry against required fields.
3. WHEN validation errors are found THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error reports without halting the entire import process.
4. WHEN the import process completes THEN the system SHALL provide a summary report of successful imports and failures.
5. WHEN resources are imported THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity with related entities (categories, tags, etc.).

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want imported resources to be automatically categorized based on their metadata, so that users can easily find relevant content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a resource is imported THEN the system SHALL assign it to appropriate categories based on provided metadata.
2. WHEN a resource's category doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create the category automatically.
3. WHEN a resource has multiple categories THEN the system SHALL support multiple category assignments.
4. WHEN categorizing resources THEN the system SHALL use a consistent taxonomy to ensure proper organization.
5. IF a resource cannot be categorized automatically THEN the system SHALL assign it to a default "Uncategorized" category.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to enrich imported resources with additional metadata, so that the resources are more discoverable and useful to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing resources THEN the system SHALL support enrichment with metadata such as difficulty level, estimated time, and resource type.
2. WHEN metadata is missing THEN the system SHALL attempt to infer it from the resource content or title.
3. WHEN resources are imported THEN the system SHALL generate SEO-friendly slugs for each resource.
4. WHEN resources contain similar content THEN the system SHALL identify and flag potential duplicates.
5. WHEN resources are imported THEN the system SHALL set appropriate default values for optional fields.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to browse and search through imported resources, so that I can find relevant learning materials quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN resources are imported THEN they SHALL be immediately searchable through the application's search functionality.
2. WHEN a user filters resources by category THEN all imported resources in that category SHALL be displayed.
3. WHEN a user sorts resources THEN imported resources SHALL be included in the sorting logic.
4. WHEN resources are displayed THEN the system SHALL respect visibility settings (published/unpublished).
5. WHEN resources are imported THEN they SHALL be indexed for efficient search operations.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to monitor and manage the resource import process, so that I can ensure data quality and system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an import process is initiated THEN the system SHALL provide progress updates.
2. WHEN the system is importing a large number of resources THEN it SHALL use batching to prevent performance issues.
3. WHEN an import process is running THEN administrators SHALL be able to pause or cancel it.
4. WHEN resources are imported THEN the system SHALL log all operations for audit purposes.
5. WHEN the import process completes THEN the system SHALL notify the administrator.
