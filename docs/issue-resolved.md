# Issue Resolved: DNS Nameserver Problem

## Final Resolution

User successfully fixed the domain issue by correcting the nameserver configuration at the registrar level.

## Root Cause
- Domain nameservers were incorrectly configured
- This caused DNS SERVFAIL errors at the delegation level
- The problem was not with DNS records, but with nameserver delegation

## Symptoms Observed
- `DNS_PROBE_POSSIBLE` errors in browser
- `dig` commands returning `SERVFAIL` status
- "at delegation cybernexacademy.com" error message
- Both root domain and www subdomain not working

## Resolution
User corrected the nameserver settings, presumably setting them to:
- `ns1.vercel-dns.com`
- `ns2.vercel-dns.com`

## Lessons Learned
1. **SERVFAIL errors** usually indicate nameserver delegation problems
2. When a previously working domain suddenly stops, check nameservers first
3. DNS record management in Vercel won't work unless nameservers are properly delegated
4. The Vercel DNS interface showing records doesn't mean they're active if nameservers are wrong

## Current Status
✅ Domain should now be working correctly
✅ All preserved DNS records (email, verification) should be active
✅ Both cybernexacademy.com and www.cybernexacademy.com should resolve

The comprehensive documentation created during troubleshooting remains valuable for future domain migrations and DNS issues.
