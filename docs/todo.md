- Console logs for auth state changes
- Debug functions: `checkUserEmailStatus()`, `debugLogin()`

### Database Schema Gaps
**Priority**: Medium  
**Status**: Needs Implementation

- **Learning progress tracking tables** - Missing detailed progress analytics
- **User achievements system** - Achievement tracking and gamification
- **Content bookmarking enhanced** - Advanced bookmarking with collections
- **Community features** - User interactions, comments, discussions

### Content & Page Development
**Priority**: Medium  
**Status**: In Progress

Most application pages exist but lack comprehensive content:
- `/academy` - Learning paths and courses need real content
- `/community` - User interaction features incomplete
- `/insights` - Cybersecurity news/articles need implementation
- `/tools` - Security tools and resources section empty
