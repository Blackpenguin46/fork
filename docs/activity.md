- Support for password and key-based authentication
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff for transient failures
- Connection validation and testing capabilities
- Proper error categorization (AuthenticationError, TimeoutError, ConnectionError)
- Connection lifecycle management (connect, disconnect, test)

## Task 5: Connection Pool Management - COMPLETED

### Actions Taken:
- Extended SSH connector with connection pooling capabilities
- Implemented connection reuse and idle connection cleanup
- Added connection limit enforcement and pool status monitoring
- Created comprehensive tests for pool operations

### Files Modified:

- Automatic cleanup of idle and stale connections
- Connection limit enforcement with proper error handling
- Pool status monitoring and management
- Lazy initialization to avoid circular dependencies

## Task 6: Command Execution Framework - COMPLETED

### Actions Taken:
- Implemented comprehensive command execution system
- Created command validation and sanitization for security
