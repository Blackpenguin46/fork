## Current Issues/Pending Work üöß

### 1. Dashboard Content Missing
**Status:** High Priority
- Dashboard loads successfully but shows placeholder content
- Tabs show "will be implemented here" messages
- Need to implement actual learning content and functionality

**Files to work on:**
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Main dashboard with placeholder content
- `components/dashboard/ProgressOverview.tsx` - Needs implementation
- Need to create actual learning paths, goals, achievements components

### 2. Page Content Missing
**Status:** Medium Priority  
- Most app pages exist but lack real content
- Navigation works but pages are empty or have placeholders

**Areas needing content:**
- `/academy` - Learning paths and courses
- `/community` - User interaction features
- `/insights` - Cybersecurity news/articles
- `/tools` - Security tools and resources

### 3. Database Schema
**Status:** Medium Priority
- User profiles and authentication working
- May need additional tables for:
  - Learning progress tracking
  - Course content
  - User achievements
  - Community features

## Next Steps (In Priority Order) üìã

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. **Test authentication end-to-end** 
   - Verify login ‚Üí dashboard flow works completely
   - Check session persistence across page refreshes
   - Test logout functionality

2. **Implement dashboard content**
   - Replace placeholder content in dashboard tabs
   - Add real progress tracking
   - Implement learning path recommendations

### Short Term
3. **Add learning content structure**
   - Design course/lesson data model
   - Create sample cybersecurity learning paths
   - Implement progress tracking

4. **Build core features**
   - Academy section with courses
   - Basic community features
   - User profile management

### Medium Term
5. **Content management**
   - Admin interface for adding courses
   - User-generated content features
   - Advanced learning analytics

## Technical Notes üîß

### Environment Setup
- **Supabase:** Configured with both naming conventions
- **Stripe:** Conditional initialization (optional)
- **Vercel:** Preview deployments from develop branch

### Key Architecture Decisions
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- Supabase for auth and database
- Client-side auth provider for session management
- Middleware for route protection

### Debugging
- Use `/debug/auth` page for authentication testing
- Console logs available for auth state changes
- Debug functions: `checkUserEmailStatus()`, `debugLogin()`

## How to Resume Development üöÄ

1. **Open terminal** in project directory
2. **Run:** `claude --resume` or `claude`
3. **Reference this file** for current status
4. **Start with:** Testing authentication and implementing dashboard content
